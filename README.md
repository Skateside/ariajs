# ARIA.js

A helper library for working with WAI-ARIA attributes, designed to make manipulating them as simple as possible.

## Documentation

The documentation for this library can be found in [the Wiki](https://github.com/Skateside/ariajs/wiki).

## Browser Support

This library has been tested in the latest browsers as well as IE11.

## State of this library

This library is currently in **alpha** as I'm still working out the finer details. Here's my to-do list:

- [x] Browser test (IE11+).
- [x] Get the `aria` property working.
- [x] Finish writing unit tests. (Except for the non-`Proxy` fall-back of `delete` which doesn't work and I don't know why.)
- [x] Write some plugins for proprietary attributes and extended roles.
- [x] Write documentation in the WIKI.
- [ ] Release for beta testing.
- [ ] Write some widgets using this library to test feasibility?
